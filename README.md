## Introduction ##

BTRunit is a lightweight service manager for use on Linux and other UNIX-like
operating systems.

## History ##

Runit was originally written by Gerrit Pape at smarden.org, based on DJB's
original daemontools service supervisor. This repo continues where Gerrit
left off.

## Improvements ##

1. All code is formatted for safety and clarity.
2. Legacy K&R C is converted to ANSI C.
3. All type warnings and signed/unsigned warnings are fixed.
4. The build system is migrated to GNU Autotools. Yes, this is
   an improvement. Just ask your local distro packager.
5. Folder directories are set at configration time. This lets you compile
   Runit with an alternate $sysconfdir, which allows you to build it and
   use it if you're not root.
6. Cross-compilation works. Legacy Runit's build system used a lot
   of runtime checks during the build process, which prevented any
   kind of cross-compilation.

## Installation ##

If you're installing from a release tarball, just `./configure`, `make`,
and `make install`. If you're installing from a repo checkout, run
`autogen.sh` first.

## Requirements ##

To build BTRunit from a release tarball, you'll need:

1. Make
2. A C compiler
3. Libc
4. That's pretty much it

To build from the repo, you'll also need m4, automake, and autoconf.

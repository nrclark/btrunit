Runit was originally written by Gerrit Pape, based on Daniel J. Bernstein's
daemontools supervision suite. A lot of the code in this repo originated
from various DJB libraries by way of Runit.

All of the code in the original Runit repo was released as public-domain
code. It was/is a mix of code from Gerrit Pape, DJB, and it's anybody's
guess who else.

Runit 2.1.2's installer wasn't particularly friendly for packagers. It
offered no way at all to cross-compile the suite, no control over the
installation, and no simple way to package for distribution. There were
also a number of compiler warnings when building the code. Formatting
was all over the map, and the codebase was a weird mix of K&R and ANSI
C.

This project aims to modernize and improve Runit by converting it
to autotools and fixing all warnings. Over time, I plan to rewrite
the suite using modern POSIX APIs (which have changed a lot since
Runit was written).
